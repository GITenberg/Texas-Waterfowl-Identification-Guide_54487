<h2 id="c3"><span class="small">FOREWORD</span></h2>
<p>The North American continent, at the time of its discovery and
early settlement, had a waterfowl population which was one of its
many wonders. So far as the evidence shows, no equal area of the
earth&rsquo;s surface ever supported such vast numbers of so many different
ducks and geese, and this situation persisted to a time within
the memory of living men. Long after the end of early settlement
on this continent, hunting was free and harvest unlimited. But as
the advancing tide of settlement reached into the north-central
prairie states and provinces in the final years of the Nineteenth
Century, radical changes began. From that time on North American
waterfowl habitat began to deteriorate. Literally millions of
acres of former nesting ground in the north have now been drained
and put to the plow. South of the breeding range, not only agriculture,
but industrialization and urbanization also have steadily
reduced available resting and wintering grounds.</p>
<p>The progressive decline in waterfowl numbers which followed
these changes in land use led eventually to the scientific management
of waterfowl. Spring shooting and market hunting were
abolished in the second decade of this century. Ten years later the
federal government undertook detailed regulation of migratory
waterfowl so the annual harvest could be made proportional to the
annual production. This was accomplished through collective
effort by State, Provincial and Federal agencies of Canada,
Mexico and the United States to obtain scientific information. In
keeping with biological principles, most of the restrictions on bag
limit and means of taking have been used with some flexibility.</p>
<p>Throughout the decline of all waterfowl populations some
species have been underharvested. These species have declined in
about the same proportion as those species on which the bulk of the
harvest occurred. The Central Flyway Council feels that a refinement
in waterfowl management is possible by directing hunting
pressure on these previously underharvested species. This goal can
only be accomplished through a knowledge of species identification
by the waterfowl hunter. This booklet is a start in that direction.</p>
<p>In recent years most waterfowl populations have made encouraging
recoveries from the low point of the early 1930&rsquo;s, when
disastrous drouths, drainage and changing land use patterns took
their toll. Still drainage continues, and industrialization is further
reducing the habitat. Hunting continues as a major sport, however,
<span class="pb" id="Page_6">6</span>
maximum utilization of all species must be accomplished if hunting
is to be fostered at a reasonable level of freedom and enjoyment.</p>
<p>The very future of duck hunting depends upon a more effective
partnership between regulatory agencies and the many thousands
of gunners whom they serve. The federal agency is charged by
treaty and law with husbandry of the waterfowl resource. The
State agencies assist in the responsibility. However, they need the
help of all sportsmen, and particularly they need the understanding
help of waterfowlers who know their birds and who keep abreast of
current plans for management. To foster this essential cooperation
between agencies and gunners is a primary purpose of this booklet.</p>
<h3 id="c4">Identification</h3>
<p>Identification of birds in the field, and particularly on the wing,
as ducks and geese are usually seen over decoys, is easier than
appears at first try. The trick is to note, in addition to shape and
approximate size, the general arrangement of light and dark
areas in the plumage, for nearly every species has its own distinctive
pattern. With practice, the eye can be trained to pick out
this pattern at a glance, and within a short time recognition becomes
automatic. The illustrations which follow, one for each important
species of Central Flyway waterfowl, make use of this
practice of &ldquo;pattern recognition&rdquo; in the two or more flying birds
at the top of the page. Actually in many cases recognition by
flight pattern and flight characteristics will soon become evident.</p>
<p>In each drawing of ducks the flying female leads, with the drake
following, for this is the usual order in a mated pair during winter,
and spring. On the lower part of each page are shown enlarged
heads, adult male on the left, female on the right, with an immature
head added when the difference is substantial, or with certain details
which further aid identification when the bird is in hand. All
ducks, both flying pairs and heads, are drawn in direct proportion
to each other, but geese, because of their larger size, are reduced
one third from the duck proportion.</p>
<p>Drawings of geese show only a single enlarged head on each
plate because male and female geese are alike in color pattern.
Finally, some birds which are not &ldquo;waterfowl&rdquo; in the strict sense
of the word, but are nevertheless often seen, are shown in the last
few illustrations. Some of them (loon, grebe, and cormorant),
although protected at all times, are included because they are
<span class="pb" id="Page_7">7</span>
often mistakenly shot for waterfowl. Others (rails, coot, and
snipes) are included because they occupy wet-land habitat along
with ducks.</p>
<h3 id="c5">Individual Problems</h3>
<p>Although &ldquo;pattern recognition&rdquo; simplifies the problem of identification
for the waterfowler, there are still several complications
to be considered. Of these, the most troublesome by far is the
matter of moults. The adult drakes of most species of ducks, very
soon after the hens begin to incubate eggs, moult the bright body-feathers
of their breeding dress and assume an &ldquo;eclipse&rdquo; plumage
which resembles the year-round coloration of the female. This dull
plumage, serving as a protective factor during the wing-moult
which follows, is retained until the new flight feathers are fully developed.
By September a second body-moult is under way by which
these old drakes assume the bright courting plumage of late fall
and winter. During the same period, the young males of the year,
whose juvenile plumage likewise resembles the female dress, are
also assuming the adult plumage. Following December 1 most
difficulties of identification by reason of the moult are resolved,
but in early fall the hunter may be puzzled by some of the transition
plumages noted on birds in his bag. Identification during this
period may appear extremely difficult, but it is well to remember
that wing patterns remain virtually unchanged regardless of stage
of the moult.</p>
<p>The remaining problems of identification require only brief mention
for they appear but rarely. In the first place, this booklet includes
all species of ducks and geese which occur in numbers in
any part of the Central Flyway, but omits others which may be
occasional visitors. Second, hybrids are rather frequent among
waterfowl, and some are extremely puzzling. In such special cases
as these your local wildlife manager or biologist may be able to
help.</p>
<p>The following publications contain further information for the
hunter interested in additional facts of natural history, distribution
and description:</p>
<dl class="undent"><dd>Kortright, &ldquo;Ducks, Geese and Swans of North America&rdquo;</dd>
<dd>Peterson, &ldquo;A Field Guide to the Birds&rdquo;</dd>
<dd>Pough, &ldquo;Audubon Water Bird Guide&rdquo;</dd></dl>
<div class="pb" id="Page_8">8</div>
<h3 id="c6">Nonhunting Enjoyments</h3>
<p>For the nonhunter&mdash;and many avid outdoorsmen prefer to watch
rather than shoot&mdash;this guide to waterfowl can provide enjoyment
beyond the simple pleasure of seeing ducks and geese. Most of
us remember seeing some &ldquo;oldtimer&rdquo; identify flights or singles or
rafts of birds at what seemed impossible distances. The ability to
do this does not really stem from some mystic communion with the
birds. Rather, through such a booklet as this the waterfowling layman
can develop the same powers in himself. For the cost of a
little concentrated effort he can gain great personal satisfaction
and the increased understanding that comes from resolving &ldquo;ducks&rdquo;
into the wide variety of individual species they really are.</p>
<p>Further, some knowledge of waterfowl distribution, annual
abundance and the approximate source and destination of the
ducks and geese he hunts, will often help the waterfowler understand
the overall picture of waterfowl management. For both administrative
and biological purposes of waterfowl management,
the United States is divided into four flyways&mdash;the Atlantic, the
Mississippi, the Pacific, and the one for which this booklet is
written, the Central. Each flyway has its own segment of the waterfowl
population, subject to different conditions and pressures than
the populations of other flyways, and therefore is administered as
a separate unit. In general this is a sound premise, but it must not
be considered too rigid. Since the flyway principle is in part an
administrative device, it is important principally in fall and winter
when most North American waterfowl are within the United States.
As the wintering populations begin to move northward in the
spring, many species disperse throughout the nesting grounds of
the northern states and Canada. Much overlapping of the populations
from various flyways in which the birds wintered occurs.</p>
<h3 id="c7">Research and Management</h3>
<p>Methods developed over the years and applied systematically
supply information which is necessary to intelligent management.
Breeding pair and brood surveys indicate the distribution of nesting
populations, and their success from year to year in hatching
and raising their broods of young. The banding of waterfowl, carefully
aged, sexed, and released, gives specific information on the
<span class="pb" id="Page_9">9</span>
travels of individual birds, on mortality, and on some phases of
hunting pressure. Periodic air-counts in late summer and fall serve
to measure, in a rough way, the distribution of different species
during southward migration, and the rate of movement. Hunter-bag
checks, carried out in the field during the shooting season,
complement fall counts with regard to distribution at given points.
A post-season sampling of hunter success, by mail, supplies data
on additional aspects of hunting pressure, and gives an index of
total kill. Finally, the annual winter count indicates the distribution
and relative size of populations remaining after the shooting
season ends. In combination, these methods are steadily increasing
our knowledge of North American waterfowl, and in particular
are providing the sort of &ldquo;running inventory&rdquo; which is the first requirement
for intelligent management of this resource.</p>
<p>The Central Flyway Council is the clearing house for coordinated
planning in this Flyway. It is a delegate organization, including
in its membership administrative and technical representatives from
the fish and game departments of all states and provinces in the
flyway. A Flyway Representative has been assigned from the Fish
and Wildlife Service. This group is concerned with all phases of
waterfowl research and management in the flyway. The Central
Flyway Council provides for an effective interchange of information
between member agencies and assists in the coordination and
integration of flyway management programs. These purposes have
been furthered by regular meetings for the open discussion of flyway
problems.</p>
<h3 id="c8">Flyway Council Approach</h3>
<p>In early 1953, the Council and the Fish and Wildlife Service,
acting jointly, adopted a flyway program which has been expanded
and improved as factual information and experience dictate.
This program outlines objectives and suggests methods and
priorities for accomplishment. State game departments now pattern
their activities around the flyway program.</p>
<p>Extending the cooperative idea, the Council has joined with
corresponding organizations from the other flyways to form the
National Waterfowl Council, which annually participates in the
official discussion of continental and flyway management problems
and regulations. From their inception, the flyway councils
<span class="pb" id="Page_10">10</span>
have been successful in promoting understanding and teamwork so
necessary for the perpetuation of the waterfowl resource.</p>
<h3 id="c9">Your Responsibility</h3>
<p>As an individual reader of this booklet, you have a part to play
in the essential partnership between agencies and waterfowlers.
Your part may be small and may take various forms, depending
on the circumstances, but certainly it is there. Perhaps, having sent
in one or two waterfowl bands in the past and having experienced
the initial novelty of hearing where your birds came from, you
now forget to report them. The next time you have this choice between
reporting or forgetting a band, remember that its prompt
recovery, with full data, might be the clue to some missing fact to
improve your future gunning.</p>
<p>Hunter bag checks indicate crippling losses in the Central
Flyway run to an average of about one quarter of the total kill. In
certain marshes, early in the season, crippling can greatly exceed
the one quarter loss. Shooting at birds on the fringe of effective
killing range is a crippling practice and, moreover, as you probably
know from observation is contagious. The usual effect of one
&ldquo;sky shooter&rdquo; in a marsh is to force other gunners nearby to attempt
impossible shots which increase crippling losses and soon
ruin shooting for everybody. Controlling such practices lies solely
in the hands of individual gunners. With large-gauge guns of
modified bore, the shot-pattern that will produce kills should be
consistent up to forty yards, a distance well within capabilities of
the average gunner to hold and compute necessary lead. Successful
duck shooting is a matter of good judgment. To avoid errors in
judgment drive stakes in front of your blind at distances of thirty
and forty yards to indicate safe killing range. Hold your fire until
the feet of an incoming duck can be seen distinctly, for only then
will the bird be in range. Good sportsmanship in duck blinds and
marshes is equally as important as remaining friendly with your
home neighbors. Train a good retrieving dog, and add to your
day&rsquo;s pleasure by watching him at work on downed birds.</p>
<p>Above all, remember that the future of waterfowling is partly in
your hands&mdash;that your good sportsmanship and cooperation are
as necessary to the work of the Central Flyway Council and its
member agencies as their activities are to you.</p>

intellectual property infringement, a defective or damaged disk or

Section 2. Information about the Mission of Project Gutenberg-tm

Project Gutenberg-tm is synonymous with the free distribution of
electronic works in formats readable by the widest variety of
computers including obsolete, old, middle-aged and new computers. It
exists because of the efforts of hundreds of volunteers and donations
from people in all walks of life.

Volunteers and financial support to provide volunteers with the
assistance they need are critical to reaching Project Gutenberg-tm's
goals and ensuring that the Project Gutenberg-tm collection will
remain freely available for generations to come. In 2001, the Project
Gutenberg Literary Archive Foundation was created to provide a secure
and permanent future for Project Gutenberg-tm and future
generations. To learn more about the Project Gutenberg Literary
Archive Foundation and how your efforts and donations can help, see
Sections 3 and 4 and the Foundation information page at
www.gutenberg.org

Section 4. Information about Donations to the Project Gutenberg
Literary Archive Foundation

Project Gutenberg-tm depends upon and cannot survive without wide
spread public support and donations to carry out its mission of
increasing the number of public domain and licensed works that can be
freely distributed in machine readable form accessible by the widest
array of equipment including outdated equipment. Many small donations
($1 to $5,000) are particularly important to maintaining tax exempt
status with the IRS.

The Foundation is committed to complying with the laws regulating
charities and charitable donations in all 50 states of the United
States. Compliance requirements are not uniform and it takes a
considerable effort, much paperwork and many fees to meet and keep up
with these requirements. We do not solicit donations in locations
where we have not received written confirmation of compliance. To SEND
DONATIONS or determine the status of compliance for any particular
state visit www.gutenberg.org/donate

While we cannot and do not solicit contributions from states where we
have not met the solicitation requirements, we know of no prohibition
against accepting unsolicited donations from donors in such states who
approach us with offers to donate.

International donations are gratefully accepted, but we cannot make
any statements concerning tax treatment of donations received from
outside the United States. U.S. laws alone swamp our small staff.

Please check the Project Gutenberg Web pages for current donation
methods and addresses. Donations are accepted in a number of other
ways including checks, online payments and credit card donations. To
donate, please visit: www.gutenberg.org/donate

Section 5. General Information About Project Gutenberg-tm electronic works.

Professor Michael S. Hart was the originator of the Project
Gutenberg-tm concept of a library of electronic works that could be
freely shared with anyone. For forty years, he produced and
distributed Project Gutenberg-tm eBooks with only a loose network of
volunteer support.

Project Gutenberg-tm eBooks are often created from several printed
editions, all of which are confirmed as not protected by copyright in
the U.S. unless a copyright notice is included. Thus, we do not
necessarily keep eBooks in compliance with any particular paper
edition.

Most people start at our Web site which has the main PG search
facility: www.gutenberg.org

This Web site includes information about Project Gutenberg-tm,
including how to make donations to the Project Gutenberg Literary
Archive Foundation, how to help produce our new eBooks, and how to
subscribe to our email newsletter to hear about new eBooks.
